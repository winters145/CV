## Jack Winterschladen

Following an eight-year-long career in management at a busy hotel, I had gotten just about all I could from hospitality; it was time for a change. 
I've always been interested in development but never had any hands-on experience. I decided to work my way through virtual coding courses on CodeAcademy,
RubyKoans and Codewars. Being able to take an idea and turn it into a fully-fledged, working program fascinates me and I knew that software development
was the right direction for me. This brought me to [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/hire/), an intensive 12-week coding bootcamp that took my fascination and turned it into a
real-world compatible set of skills that has prepared me to take the next step in my career.

## Work Experience

**Grand Hotel** (December 2013 - September 2021)  
_Food & Beverage Manager_

- Starting as part-time waiting staff in 2013, I quickly worked my way up into a managerial position, with my own department of staff.
- I was in charge of all food and drinks service at the hotel, including a busy restaurant, three large function rooms and two seperate lounge/ bar areas.
- When our 'Master of Ceremonies' retired, I took the opportunity to take on this position, allowing me to not only manage the staff,
  but take on a more direct role with The Bride and Groom and run the flow of their guests and special day. As someone who thought myself adverse to public speaking,
  this was a huge step that took me right out of my comfort zone and gave me great new-found confidence and skills.
- On working closely with each wedding over the years, the Grand Hotel has won multiple awards at the North of England Wedding Awards.
- Implemented and maintained a new till system througout the hotel, constantly updating it with the latest menus and keeping track of stock.
- Implemented and maintained a new booking system, enabling easy management of customer flow and busy periods. 


## Skills

#### Organizational / People skills 

Through working in a front-of-house managerial role for over five years, my people skills have been truly tested.
Given the non-stop busy nature of the hotel, it has been vital that I work well under pressure and maintain excellent
patience and communication skills. 

#### Fast learning

I am quick to take on infoprmation and learn new skills. For our final project at Makers we implemented React for our front-end, having no prior experience with it. I taught myself how to set up and work the new till and booking systems when working at my previous job and had to teach other senior staff in how to use them.

#### Attention to detail

Working in a fine-dining environment and overseeing the preparation and setting up for countless weddings I've always needed a keen eye when it comes to detail.
A skill that I've found has followed me into the world of programming, making sure everything is neat and in line.

#### Team player

The key to success in my previous job was creating and being part of a well established and reliable team; a trait that has proven invaluble during my time working on group projects at Makers.

#### Thrives under-pressure

As is the way of hospitality, much of my time was spent in fast paced, busy environments, where outstanding service was always at the forefront.
Over time I've come to thrive under such presssure; a skill that was again put to the test by the intense nature of the 12-week long Makers Bootcamp.
