Following an eight-year-long career in management at a busy hotel, I had gotten just about all I could from hospitality; it was time for a change. 
I've always been interested in development but never had any hands-on experience. I decided to work my way through virtual coding courses on CodeAcademy,
RubyKoans and Codewars. Being able to take an idea and turn it into a fully-fledged, working program fascinates me and I knew that software development
was the right direction for me. This brought me to [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/hire/), an intensive 12-week coding bootcamp that took my fascination and turned it into a
real-world compatible set of skills that has prepared me to take the next step in my career.

## Work Experience

**Grand Hotel** (December 2013 - October 2021)  
_Food & Beverage Manager_

- Starting as part-time waiting staff in 2013, I quickly worked my way up into a managerial position, with my own department of staff.
- I was in charge of all food and drinks service at the hotel, including a busy restaurant, three large function rooms and two seperate lounge/ bar areas.
- I took the opportunity to utilise my public speaking and time-management skills by taking on the role of Toastmaster for the weddings, ensuring a smooth, stress-free day and ultimately helping the hotel win multiple awards at the North of England Wedding Awards.
- Introduced new till & booking systems, training staff and overseeing its integration, ensuring improved customer experience and manageability of busy periods.


## Skills

#### Strong Communicator & Team Player

Through working in a front-of-house managerial role for over five years, my people skills have been truly tested.
Given the non-stop busy nature of the hotel, it has been vital that I ensure the team works well under pressure whilst maintaining excellent
patience and communication skills; something I utilised well during our team projects at Makers. For example, ensuring that we always had open zoom calls that could be frequently dropped in and out of when a pair needed help, or to provide regular check-ins.

#### Fast learning

I am quick to take on information and learn new skills. I went from writing my first piece of code to being accepted onto the highly selective Makers Academy Bootcamp within a month.
For our final project at Makers we implemented React as our front-end tech, despite having no prior experience with it.
I taught myself how to set up and work the new till and booking systems when working at my previous job and had to train other senior staff on how to use them.

#### Thrives under-pressure & Attention to detail

As is the way of hospitality, much of my time was spent in fast paced, busy environments, where outstanding service was always at the forefront.
Over time I've come to thrive under such pressure; a skill that was again put to the test by the intense nature of the 12-week long Makers Bootcamp, having only a week or two to build entire applications from scratch.
Working in a fine-dining environment and overseeing the preparation and setting up for countless weddings has meant I've always needed a keen eye when it comes to detail. A trait that I've found has followed me into the world of programming, making sure everything is neat, clear and in-line.


## Education

#### Makers Academy Coding Bootcamp (January 2022 - April 2022)
- Object Orientated Programming, focusing on encapsulation through the use of classes and methods  
- Strong focus on the use of Test Driven Development
- Frequent use of pair programming and group projects, replying heavily on agile teamwork and communication
- Full-stack web development, in both JavaScript (M.E.R.N) & Ruby
- EQ curriculum, enhancing my already well practised skills in empathy, feedback & teamwork
- Gained in-depth knowledge of JavaScript & Ruby syntax, as well as HTML and CSS, with a great base of knowledge, ability and desire to learn more


## Hobbies

- Playing Tennis (weather dependent!) - I'm no Andy Murray, but I've got a mean forehand!
- [Watching] Football - I'm lucky enough to be a Newcastle United fan
- Travelling - Somewhat halted by the pandemic, my favourite destination so far is Vietnam!
